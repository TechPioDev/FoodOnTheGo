/// behave natively: each branch keeps its own `Navigator` and its own state, so
/// scrolling Orders halfway, visiting Profile and coming back returns to where
/// you were rather than to the top of a rebuilt list. A plain `IndexedStack` of
/// screens would preserve widget state but give every tab one shared navigation
/// history, which breaks Android's back button.
///
/// Nested routes for later modules attach beneath the branch they belong to —
/// `/orders/:reference` under the Orders branch — and inherit its back stack for
/// free.
