# 08 — Design system

Two implementations of one system:

| | File |
| --- | --- |
| Web | `web/packages/ui/src/tokens.css` |
| Flutter | `mobile/lib/core/theme/tokens.dart` |

They cannot share a file, so **this document is the contract**. A change to one is a change to both.

## Rule

Components reference tokens. A hex code, a raw pixel value or a bare duration inside a component is
a bug. Names are semantic (`--color-danger`), never literal (`--color-red`).

## Colour

**Primary — amber/saffron.** Food, and highway signage. Deliberately not the red every delivery
competitor uses.

**Secondary — deep teal.** The journey half of the product: routes, maps, ETA. Keeping "the road"
and "the food" in different hues means a screen showing both is readable at a glance.

| Token | Light | Dark |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `primary-600` | `#EF6008` | — |
| `primary-700` | `#C64709` | — |
| `primary-400` | — | `#FF9A38` |
| `secondary-600` | `#0D9488` | `#14B8A6` |
| `background` | `#FAFAF9` | `#0C0A09` |
| `surface` | `#FFFFFF` | `#1C1917` |
| `text-primary` | `#1C1917` | `#FAFAF9` |
| `text-secondary` | `#57534E` | `#A8A29E` |

### `--color-primary-interactive` exists for a reason

White text on `primary-600` measures **3.31:1** — below the WCAG AA floor of 4.5:1 for normal text.
`primary-700` is **4.88:1**.

So `--color-primary-interactive` (`primary-700` in light, `primary-500` in dark) is the shade used
**wherever text sits on the brand colour** — filled buttons, the brand mark, the skip link.
`primary-600` remains correct for rails, dots and decoration carrying no text.

This was a real defect in the first cut of the palette, caught by a contrast test in
`mobile/test/tokens_test.dart` which computes the WCAG ratio and fails if it regresses.

## Typography

Body text floor is **16sp/16px**, prose floor **15**. This is read at arm's length on a phone mount,
often in motion — the 12–13px that passes on a desktop dashboard is not legible there. 13 is
permitted for metadata (timestamps, counts) only.

| Step | Size |
| --- | --- |
| Display | 40 / 34 |
| H1 | 32 / 28 |
| H2 | 24 |
| H3 | 20 |
| H4 | 18 |
| Body large | 18 / 17 |
| Body | 16 |
| Body small | 15 |
| Label | 14 |
| Caption | 13 — metadata only |

### Font family

Flutter uses the **platform font** (`fontFamily = null`): Roboto on Android, San Francisco on iOS.

Naming `'Roboto'` explicitly was a real bug: it is not a system font on iOS, so iOS fell back
silently, and on Flutter web the engine tried to fetch it from a CDN. Bundling a brand face is a
deliberate change here **plus** an asset in `pubspec.yaml` — never an unbundled name.

Component themes derive their text styles from the themed `TextTheme` rather than constructing bare
`TextStyle`s, so a bundled family would apply to app bars and chips too. Constructing one fresh
silently drops the family.

## Spacing

4px base: `4 · 8 · 12 · 16 · 20 · 24 · 32 · 40 · 48 · 64`. Anything off the grid is an accident.

## Radius

`xs 4 · sm 6 · md 10 · lg 14 · xl 20 · full 9999`. Cards `lg`, controls `md`, pills/sheets `full`/`xl`.

## Elevation

Four steps only — `xs · sm · md · lg`. More and nothing reads as raised.

## Motion

| Token | Duration |
| --- | --- |
| instant | 80ms |
| fast | 140ms |
| normal | 220ms |
| slow | 320ms |

Standard easing `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)`.

Short on purpose: in a moving vehicle a long transition reads as lag, not polish.

**`prefers-reduced-motion` is honoured at the token level** on web (durations become 0) and through
`FotgMotion.respectingReducedMotion` in Flutter. This is an accessibility control — vestibular
disorders make large transitions genuinely unpleasant.

## Icons

**One family per platform, never mixed.**

- Web: **Lucide** (`lucide-react`), stroke width 1.8–1.9, sizes 16/19/22/26.
- Flutter: **Material Symbols** (built in), outlined for rest, rounded-filled for selected.

The selected state changes **shape as well as colour**, so the current tab is distinguishable without
relying on hue.

No emoji in product UI, no Font Awesome, no one-off SVGs.

## Touch targets

**44px minimum on web, 48dp on mobile.** WCAG 2.2 asks for 44; mobile uses 48 because this app is
tapped one-handed by someone about to drive. Verified by an automated sweep across eight viewport
widths, and by a unit test on the mobile token.

## Z-index

A declared scale so no component invents `z-index: 99999`:
`base 0 · sticky 100 · sidebar 200 · topbar 300 · overlay 400 · modal 500 · popover 600 · toast 700`.

## Responsive breakpoints (web)

| Range | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| ≥1024px | Sidebar in the grid; collapsible to a 72px rail |
| 768–1023px | Sidebar becomes an overlay drawer; account name hidden |
| <900px | API health pill collapses to a dot |
| <768px | Search hidden; padding reduced |
| <480px | Breadcrumbs reduced to the current page |

Every flex child of the topbar sets `min-width: 0`. Without it one longer string —
"API unreachable" instead of "API local" — pushes the bar past the viewport. That was a real defect:
the layout only fitted while the API was up.

## Order status visual language (Module 02)

Six states, each varying **three** things — colour, icon and label — because colour alone is not a
usable signal:

| State | Icon | Tone |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Placed | `receipt_long_outlined` | Info blue |
| Accepted | `check_circle_outline` | Teal (secondary) |
| Cooking | `local_fire_department_outlined` | Amber (warning) |
| Ready for pickup | `takeout_dining_outlined` | Green (success) |
| Picked up | `task_alt_outlined` | Neutral |
| Cancelled | `cancel_outlined` | Red (error) |

A cancelled order renders **no** progress track: drawing the remaining steps as "still to come" for
an order that will never reach them would be a lie.

## Button sizing — a trap worth naming

Use `Size(0, height)` for a minimum size, never `Size.fromHeight(height)`. The latter sets width to
`double.infinity`, which forces every button to fill its parent and silently defeats any `expand`
parameter. Width is the caller's decision; only the height floor belongs to the theme.

## Accessibility baseline

- Visible `:focus-visible` ring on every interactive element
- Skip link to main content
- The navigation landmark is labelled on the `<nav>`, not the `<aside>` (`<aside>` is
  `complementary`, so labelling it does not name the navigation)
- Disabled controls keep a legible label — Material's default disabled opacity rendered button text
  effectively invisible, which is fixed in the Flutter theme
- Body contrast ≥ 4.5:1 in both themes, asserted by test
