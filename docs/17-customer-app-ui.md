## The authentication screens

Four screens, each with one job, and a guard that decides which of them (or the shell) is on screen.
The reasoning behind each control is in
[18-customer-authentication.md](18-customer-authentication.md); what matters for the UI:

**Welcome** explains the product before asking for anything. A sign-in screen that opens with a
phone field is the last screen a lot of people see. The copy scrolls and the action is pinned, so it
stays reachable at a 1.4× text scale on a short device.

**Phone entry** asks for a number and nothing else — no device id, no referral code, no marketing
opt-in. The country picker is a bottom sheet rather than a dropdown: at four markets a dropdown
would do, but a sheet stays usable at twenty and at large text sizes. The picker sits inside the
field as a `prefix`, so the dial code and the digits share a baseline and read as one number.

**Code entry** is one real text field behind the appearance of digit boxes, never one field per
digit: separate fields look identical and behave badly — they break paste, fight SMS autofill, and
make backspacing an accessibility problem. Two countdowns run, both a courtesy over a server rule.
An expired or exhausted code clears the field and ends the countdown, which turns *Resend code* on:
the screen offers the action that can actually help rather than inviting another doomed attempt.

**Registration** shows the verified number back as a chip and has no field to change it. First name
is required; surname is optional because plenty of people have one name, and a required surname is a
wall they cannot pass. Email is optional and labelled with why it is wanted.

Every failure is a sentence the customer can act on, chosen by the API's machine-readable error code
— never the server's own prose, which is free to be reworded or translated.

## Journeys

The Trips tab is a list with a three-way segmented control above it — Upcoming,
Past, Cancelled — and the same four states as every other list in this app.
A row leads with the route, because "New Delhi → Jaipur" is how somebody
identifies their own journey; the departure is the second line, because it is how
they tell two journeys on the same route apart.

Cancelled and departed are spelled out as words in a badge, never signalled by
colour alone. The row's overflow menu names its own journey ("Options for New
Delhi → Jaipur"), and it is offered only while the server says the journey can
still be changed — a menu that offers an edit the server will refuse teaches
people not to trust the menu.

Each scope has its own empty wording, because "no journeys" under Past means
something different from "no journeys" under Upcoming, and only one of the three
is worth offering a button for.

### The planner

One screen for planning and editing. A place is *chosen*, not typed into the
form: a sheet offers the customer's saved addresses first — this is what Module
04 was for — and a short form for anywhere else. There is no map and no
autocomplete, and the typed branch produces no coordinates; a suggestion here
would be a guess presented as a fact.

The arrival field says plainly that nothing computes it yet, rather than leaving
a blank that looks like a failure.

Both Module 04 layout rules apply, in the planner and in the picker sheet: a
non-lazy scrolling `Column` so validation cannot skip an off-screen field, and a
pinned primary action so it is never under the keyboard or the navigation bar.

### On home

Home shows the customer's real next journey when there is one, and nothing at all
when there is not. The card shows where, when and how many — no progress bar, no
remaining time, no next pickup. Module 02's card drew all three from fixture
data; a progress bar at zero would imply the app is tracking a journey it cannot
see.

## The three home states

The layout is **conditional, not padded**. A customer with no journey sees no journey section — not
an empty container captioned "no journey". An empty shell is worse than an absent one: it implies
something is broken.

| State | Journey | Order | Explainer |
| --- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| New customer | — | — | ✅ How FoodOnTheGo works |
| Active journey | ✅ | — | — |
| Active order | ✅ | ✅ | — |

The explainer earns its place only when there is nothing more useful to show; once a real journey
exists it disappears rather than pushing real content down.

## Design decisions

**The planner is a route, not a form.** An origin dot, a dashed line, a destination pin — that is the
product in one glance. Two stacked text fields look like every other search screen.

**The fields are tappable rows, not `TextField`s.** They accept no input in this module, so rendering
them as text fields would open a keyboard onto a control that cannot be typed into. That is the whole
of the keyboard story for Module 02: there is no editable control anywhere in the customer app yet.

**The order card leads with *when to be there*, not what was ordered.** The countdown is the largest
element; the status track sits beneath it. A traveller deciding whether to pull over needs one number.

**The countdown floors at zero.** An estimate the clock has overtaken reads "Ready now", never
"-3 min".

**Order status varies three things, not one.** Colour, icon and label. Roughly one man in twelve
cannot reliably separate amber "Cooking" from green "Ready" — and that is the moment that matters
most.

**A cancelled order draws no progress track.** Rendering the remaining steps as "still to come" for
an order that will never reach them would be a lie.

**Empty states teach.** They say what will appear, why it is worth having, and offer the one action
that fills it.

## The route motif

The product is FOOD + ROUTE + TIME + PICKUP, and the route half is carried by a recurring visual:

- a ringed origin dot and a destination pin in the planner, joined by a dashed line
- the same pairing, horizontal, on the journey card, with a progress bar between them
- a dashed ring around every empty-state icon — a road circling the subject
- numbered stops joined by a line in *How FoodOnTheGo works*

Teal is the journey; amber is the food. Keeping them in different hues means a screen showing both is
readable at a glance.

## Reusable components

| Component | Location |
| --- | --- |
| `PrimaryButton` / `SecondaryButton` / `LinkAction` | `shared/widgets/buttons.dart` |
| `SectionHeader` | `shared/widgets/section_header.dart` |
| `EmptyStateView` | `shared/widgets/empty_state_view.dart` |
| `AppErrorView` | `shared/widgets/app_error_view.dart` |
| `OfflineBanner` | `shared/widgets/offline_banner.dart` |
| `AppSkeleton` / `HomeSkeleton` | `shared/widgets/app_skeleton.dart` |
| `OrderStatusChip` / `OrderStatusTrack` | `shared/widgets/order_status_chip.dart` |
| `CustomerShell` | `shared/widgets/customer_shell.dart` |
| `GreetingHeader`, `JourneyPlannerCard`, `RouteSummaryCard`, `ActiveOrderCard`, `QuickActions`, `HowItWorks` | `features/home/widgets/` |

### Empty states on a short screen

`EmptyStateView` shrinks its motif and tightens its spacing below 420px of
height. The illustration is decoration; the action under it is not, and on a
320×568 screen only one of the two fits above the fold. Measured, not guessed:
the Trips action landed 13px below the display before this rule existed.

## Loading, error, offline

**Loading** is a skeleton shaped like the content it replaces — greeting line, planner card, journey
card — so the page does not visibly reflow when data lands. A centred spinner tells the user nothing
about what is coming. The shimmer stops under `prefers-reduced-motion`.

**Errors** map a `HomeFailureKind` to a cause the customer can act on, with distinct wording for
offline, timeout, server-unavailable and unknown. A raw exception is never rendered: it is
meaningless to a traveller, and a stack trace in a screenshot is an information leak.

**Offline** is a non-blocking banner below the status bar. Someone who has lost signal should still
be able to read the order already on screen; a modal would take away the only useful thing left. It
is a live region, so a screen reader announces the change.

## Animation

| Where | What | Duration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bottom navigation | Indicator slide, icon fill | 220ms |
| Journey progress | Bar grows from zero on first paint | 320ms decelerate |
| Order status track | Segments fill in sequence | 320ms |
| Offline banner | Height in/out, content settles rather than jumps | 220ms |
| Buttons | Material ink + 1px press translate | 80ms |
| Skeletons | Shimmer sweep | 1200ms loop |

Short on purpose: in a moving vehicle a long transition reads as lag, not polish. Everything routes
through `FotgMotion.respectingReducedMotion`, and the skeleton stops looping entirely.

Nothing pulses, bounces or animates on every element.

## Accessibility

- **48dp touch targets**, above the 44pt/48dp floor, because this is tapped one-handed by someone
  about to drive. The avatar's tappable box is 48 even though the circle is 46.
- **Text scaling honoured and clamped to 1.4x.** Android allows 2.0x, which turns a 34sp greeting
  into 68sp and pushes the primary action off screen.
- **The greeting steps down on narrow screens.** At 34sp on 320dp it truncated to
  "Good evening, R…", losing the name — the entire point of a greeting.
- **Semantic labels** on the avatar, status chips, progress track, quick actions and route endpoints;
  `header: true` on section titles so a screen-reader user can jump between sections.
- **Status is never conveyed by colour alone.**
- **`SafeArea` everywhere**, never hard-coded insets, with edge-to-edge system bars.

## Light and dark

Both are supported and follow the OS (`ThemeMode.system`). A phone in a windscreen cradle at night is
in dark mode for a reason.

## Orientation

Portrait only for now (`main.dart`). Landscape is a real layout with real work behind it; shipping a
stretched portrait layout would be worse than not offering it.

## The profile identity block

From Module 03 the header reads the **session**, not the home dashboard: name, initials and the
masked number come from the signed-in account. The number is masked even here, on the account's own
screen — a phone is read over shoulders and screenshotted into support tickets, and the last four
digits are enough to confirm which number it is.

Sign out is behind a confirmation dialog. That is not friction for its own sake: signing back in
means waiting for an SMS, so an accidental tap in a list people scroll has a real cost.

From Module 04 the first two rows open real screens. **Edit profile** offers exactly three fields —
first name, last name, email — and renders the verified number as a locked field with a lock icon and
a sentence explaining that it is the verified number for this account. It is not a disabled text
input the customer might try to fight; it looks like what it is, a fact about the account rather than
a field. **Saved addresses** shows a live count in its trailing text, so the row says something
before it is tapped.

The rest of the list still routes to a controlled placeholder naming its module. A form that
silently discards what somebody typed is worse than one that is honestly not there yet.

## Saved addresses

The list is default-first, then newest, and each row carries its type icon, its label, a one-line
address and — on the default — the word **DEFAULT**, spelled out rather than signalled by colour
alone. The row menu is a single overflow button whose tooltip names its row ("Options for Home"),
because a screen reader announcing "Edit" four times tells you nothing about which one you are on.

Four states, all real:

- **Loading** — a skeleton of the list shape, not a spinner on a blank screen, so the layout does not
  jump when the data lands.
- **Empty** — an illustration, a sentence, and the add button as the primary action. This is the
  first thing a new customer sees, so it is a starting point rather than an apology.
- **Error** — the message the error code maps to, plus Retry. Never the server's prose.
- **List** — pull to refresh, and a per-row busy state so setting a default disables that row rather
  than freezing the screen.

Nothing here is optimistic. A row does not show DEFAULT until the server has confirmed the change, an
address is not added to the list until it has an id from the database, and a deletion removes the row
only after the server has deleted it. If the server refuses, the list is what the server says it is
and a snackbar says what went wrong.

### The form

One screen for create and edit, because they are the same fields and two screens would drift apart.
The type selector is a segmented control; choosing **Other** reveals the label field, and it is
required only there — Home and Work name themselves.

Two layout rules were learned the hard way and are pinned by tests. The form scrolls in a **non-lazy
`Column`**, not a `ListView`: `ListView` builds lazily, so a field scrolled off screen is never
registered with the `Form` and `validate()` skips it silently. And the primary action is **pinned to
the bottom** above the keyboard, not placed after the last field, where on a small screen it sat
under the bottom navigation bar and the tap went to the wrong widget.

## Development harness

A floating control (development builds only) that switches persona, forces offline, and forces a
failure — so the loading, error and offline states can be *inspected in a running app*, not merely
asserted in tests. It renders `child` untouched when the environment forbids fixtures.
