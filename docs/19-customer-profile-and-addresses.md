# 19 — Customer profile and saved addresses

What a customer may change about themselves, where they save the places they
travel from, and why each boundary is where it is.

Module 04. Read [18-customer-authentication.md](18-customer-authentication.md)
first — the identity this builds on is established there.

## What a customer owns

Three fields: **first name, last name, email**. That is the whole editable
surface, and the list is short deliberately.

| Field | Editable | Required | Validated | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `first_name` | ✅ | ✅ | 1–80 chars, must contain a letter | The name the kitchen reads out |
| `last_name` | ✅ | ➖ | ≤ 80 chars | Plenty of people have one name |
| `email` | ✅ | ➖ | RFC syntax, unique | Receipts, and nothing else |
| `phone_e164` | ❌ | — | — | **Identity.** See below |
| `phone_verified_at` | ❌ | — | — | Set by an OTP, never by a request |
| `role`, `status` | ❌ | — | — | Privilege, not self-service |

Nothing else is collected. No date of birth, no gender, no government id, no
workplace, no contacts, no location history. A field that is not collected
cannot be leaked, cannot be wrong, and cannot need a deletion process.

### The verified number is not a profile field

`PATCH /customer/profile` accepts a body containing `phone_e164` and changes
nothing. That is enforced in three independent places, and any one of them would
be enough:

1. `UpdateProfileRequest` declares no rule for it, so `validated()` never
   contains the key;
2. `CustomerProfileService::update()` reads three keys by name;
3. `User::$fillable` would refuse it anyway.

Three, because a change to one of them should not become a vulnerability.

The request is **accepted and ignored**, not rejected. Rejecting would tell a
prober which field names the server finds interesting.

Changing a mobile number is a real requirement and will be a real feature: an
OTP re-verification flow of its own, in a later module. It is never a PATCH.

### Changing an email un-verifies it

`email_verified_at` is cleared whenever the address changes. There is no email
verification flow yet, so in practice it is always null — this exists so that
adding one later cannot leave a "verified" flag attached to an address somebody
swapped in afterwards.

Nothing in the UI says an email is verified, because nothing verifies it.

## Saved addresses

A customer saves the places they travel from. Module 05's trip planner will offer
them as one-tap origins and destinations, which is why the shape here is
structured rather than a free-text blob.

### The data

```
id · uuid · customer_id · type · label
address_line_1 · address_line_2 · landmark · city · state · postal_code · country_code
formatted_address
latitude · longitude · place_id
is_default · created_at · updated_at
```

`type` is `HOME`, `WORK` or `OTHER` — a fixed set, because the trip planner
cannot offer "Home" as a one-tap origin against a string somebody typed. What the
customer *calls* the place is `label`, which is free text, required for `OTHER`
and defaulted from the type otherwise. "Other" in a list of three Others is
unreadable.

`formatted_address` is composed by the server from the parts, so the app and the
server never disagree about one address. The landmark is deliberately left out of
it: it helps somebody find the door and is shown beside the address, but inside a
one-line address it is noise and useless to a geocoder.

### At most one default, guaranteed by the database

```sql
default_for_customer BIGINT UNSIGNED
  GENERATED ALWAYS AS (IF(is_default = 1, customer_id, NULL)) STORED,
UNIQUE KEY customer_addresses_one_default_unique (default_for_customer)
```

MySQL has no partial indexes, so the generated column holds the customer id only
while the row is the default and NULL otherwise — and MySQL does not collide
NULLs in a unique index. Two concurrent "make this my default" requests cannot
both win, whatever the application does.

`CustomerAddressService` still takes a row lock inside a transaction, because a
clean error beats a constraint violation. But that is the second line of defence,
not the only one, and a test asserts the guarantee by writing around the service
entirely.

**The cost, stated plainly.** MySQL refuses `ON DELETE CASCADE` on a column that
a stored generated column depends on (error 1215), so the foreign key is
`RESTRICT`. Erasing a customer must delete their addresses first. That is the
better trade: a hard delete with addresses still attached fails loudly instead of
silently destroying them, and an erasure path needs an explicit audit trail
anyway.

### The default rules

- **The first address a customer saves becomes their default**, whether or not
  they asked. A list with no default makes the trip planner ask "from where?" to
  somebody who has already answered that once.
- **Setting a new default clears the old one**, inside one transaction.
- **Deleting the default promotes the newest survivor**, deterministically. The
  newest is the best available guess at where somebody is living or working now.
- **`PATCH {"is_default": false}` is ignored.** Un-defaulting by PATCH would
  leave a customer with addresses and no default, which every other rule works to
  avoid. Choosing a different default is what setting one on another address is
  for.
- Deleting the *last* address leaves no default, which is correct — there is
  nothing to promote.

### Deletion is permanent

Hard delete, not soft. An address is personal location data, and a customer who
removes one has asked for it to be gone; keeping a hidden copy is the opposite of
what they said.

**This places a requirement on the order and trip modules**: a historical order or
trip must store a *snapshot* of the address it used, not a reference to a mutable
row. That is the correct design regardless — an order shipped to an address the
customer has since edited should show the address it was shipped to.

### Limits

`ADDRESS_MAX_PER_CUSTOMER`, default 25. An anti-abuse ceiling rather than a
product limit: a traveller with home, work, two sets of parents and a few regular
stops is nowhere near it, and an account cannot be used as free storage. It is
configuration, so it can move without a deployment of new code.

## Postal codes are per country

"Six digits" is an Indian rule, not a universal one. The UK's are alphanumeric
and contain a space; Ireland's Eircodes are seven alphanumerics; the UAE has no
postal code system in general use.

| Country | Rule | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IN | `[1-9]\d{5}` | ✅ |
| GB | outward + inward, optional space | ✅ |
| US | `\d{5}(-\d{4})?` | ✅ |
| AE | — | ❌ |
| anything else | length only | ❌ |

A country with no rule is **accepted**, not blocked. An address that cannot be
saved is a worse failure than a postcode nobody checked, and the launch market is
covered exactly.

The client mirrors this table (`postal_code_rules.dart`) so the form can pick a
keyboard and give feedback before the first keystroke reaches a server. It is
only ever allowed to be more permissive than the server, never less — a client
stricter than the server rejects addresses that are actually valid. The numeric
keypad appears only where the format is numeric, because a UK postcode typed on
one cannot be entered at all.

---

## Ownership

**No route carries a customer id.** Not `PATCH /customer/profile/{id}`, not
`GET /customer/{id}/addresses`. The actor is the token, so there is no ownership
check to forget and no id for a caller to change.

Addresses are reached only through `CustomerAddressService::ownedByOrFail()`,
which queries a scope already bound to the caller. Route-model binding would load
the row first and leave the ownership check as a separate step somebody could
omit; this way there is one path to an address and it cannot return one belonging
to anybody else.

**An address owned by somebody else and an address that does not exist give the
identical answer**: 404 `ADDRESS_NOT_FOUND`, with the same message. Distinguishing
them would turn the endpoint into an oracle — walk a range of ids, and
403-versus-404 maps out which ones are real addresses belonging to real customers.

`customer_id` in a request body is inert. It is not fillable on the model, the
form request declares no rule for it, and the service sets ownership from the
authenticated actor. `AddressOwnershipTest` sends `customer_id`, `user_id`,
`customer_uuid` and `created_by` in one payload and asserts the address belongs
to the caller.

## The API

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/v1/customer/profile` | The signed-in customer |
| PATCH | `/api/v1/customer/profile` | Name and email, nothing else |
| GET | `/api/v1/customer/addresses` | Their addresses, default first |
| POST | `/api/v1/customer/addresses` | Save one |
| GET | `/api/v1/customer/addresses/{uuid}` | One of theirs |
| PATCH | `/api/v1/customer/addresses/{uuid}` | Change one |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/customer/addresses/{uuid}` | Remove one |
| POST | `/api/v1/customer/addresses/{uuid}/default` | Make it the default |

Every one requires `auth:sanctum` + `role:customer` + `abilities:customer`, the
three gates established in Module 03.

Setting the default has **both** a dedicated endpoint and `PATCH {"is_default":
true}`, because they are different intents. The dedicated one changes nothing
else and is safe to retry, which matters for a control somebody taps in a list.

`POST /customer/addresses` honours Module 01's `Idempotency-Key`, so a client
that retries a lost response gets the same address rather than a second one.

New error codes: `ADDRESS_NOT_FOUND` (404) and `ADDRESS_LIMIT_REACHED` (422).

## Google Places, and what is deliberately deferred

The schema carries `latitude`, `longitude`, `place_id` and `formatted_address`
because the trip planner will need to route between saved addresses. All of them
accept values from a client that has them.

**They stay NULL until something actually geocodes.** Inventing coordinates from
a typed address would produce a route to a place the customer never chose, and
`0, 0` is a real place in the Gulf of Guinea — a route to it is a route into the
Atlantic. `SavedAddress.hasCoordinates` exists so a caller must decide what to do
when they are absent rather than substituting a number.

**Google Places enrichment will be connected during the mapping and location
implementation.** When it is, a Places-backed picker fills these four fields at
save time and `formatted_address` becomes Google's rather than the composed one.
Nothing else changes: the columns, the validation ranges and the API shape are
already in place.

## On the device

**State is scoped to the session, structurally.** `AddressesController.build()`
*watches* the auth state, so ending a session rebuilds the provider from nothing
and starting a new one fetches fresh. There is no cache-clearing step to
remember, because there is no state that survives the session — which is what
makes the Rahul → sign out → Ananya test pass without a single stale frame.

**Nothing is optimistic.** The server owns the one-default rule and the address
limit, so a list updated before the server answers can show a default it rejected
or an address it never saved. Every write re-reads the server's result, and no
screen says "saved" until the server has said so.

**Reads may be stale; writes require connectivity.** A previously loaded list
stays on screen when the network drops. A create, edit or delete that cannot
reach the server fails with "you need a connection to save this. Nothing has been
changed" — an honest statement rather than a queued write that might silently
never land. A queued-sync architecture is a real feature with real conflict rules,
and building half of it would be worse than not building it.

**Forms use a non-lazy scrolling Column, not a ListView.** A `ListView` builds
lazily, so a field scrolled out of view is not in the tree — and a `FormField`
that is not in the tree is never registered with the `Form`, so `validate()`
silently skips it. On a phone that meant tapping Save with a city nothing had
checked.

**The primary action is pinned to the bottom.** A seven-field address form is
taller than a phone, so a Save button at the end of the scroll is invisible on
arrival and is the first thing the keyboard covers.

---

## Accessibility

- The verified number is a labelled panel, not a disabled `TextField`. A
  greyed-out input invites tapping and then does nothing, which reads as a bug.
- **"Verified" and "Default" are words**, not a green tick and a coloured dot.
  Neither state is communicable by colour or shape alone.
- Each row's overflow button is labelled *"Options for Home"*, not "Edit" — the
  menu also deletes, and three identically-labelled buttons are indistinguishable
  to a screen reader.
- Each address row reads as one thing, in the order somebody needs it: label,
  whether it is the default, then where it is.
- Below 320dp of usable width the type selector drops its icons rather than
  wrapping its labels, because the label is the part that carries the meaning.
- Destructive actions are behind a confirmation, never behind a swipe.

## Known limitation

Deleting a customer account is blocked while they have saved addresses, by the
`RESTRICT` foreign key. That is deliberate (see above) and the erasure path in a
later module must delete addresses explicitly. Recorded as KI-009.
