## Module 01 detail

**40 of 43 requirements COMPLETE.** Three are BLOCKED by the build environment, not by design:

| ID | Requirement | Blocker |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M01-R41 | Android build validation | `dl.google.com` denied by egress policy (KI-001) |
| M01-R42 | iOS build validation | Requires macOS + Xcode; environment is Linux (KI-002) |
| M01-R43 | PHP static analysis in CI | PHPStan uninstallable via Composer here (KI-003) |

**115 automated tests pass.** All static checks pass. Both web shells and the Flutter app were run
and visually inspected.

## Module 02 detail

**30 of 32 requirements PASSED or COMPLETE.** The two blocked are M02-017 (Android) and M02-018
(iOS) — the same environment restrictions as Module 01, not code defects.

**82 mobile tests pass** (up from 19). `flutter analyze --fatal-infos` clean, `dart format` clean.
All eleven required live-view states were inspected in a rendered app. Module 01 regression: **PASS**
(67 backend + 29 web tests, both web builds).

Eight defects were found and fixed during the module; none left open.

Module 03 has **not** been started, per the one-module-at-a-time rule.
